# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver using Genteic Algorithm


## Genetic Solver
The `tspga.h` is the header required for the genetic solver. It accepts a file name e.g. `48.txt` and returns the solution: a sequence of node indices that must be visited. The total distance travelled in the solution is tried to be minimized.

## Ungoing project
Although the current solution is not implelmented in template format, the future plan is to make it more general. Some extra files in the project is created for this purpose. However, it is not done because of a hard deadline for reaching the solution for the TSP.
